# 🧠 Automated Neural Architecture Search for Chest X-ray Classification

This project implements an **Automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** system using **Genetic Algorithms** and **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** to automatically design and optimize **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architectures for **chest X-ray image classification**.

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal is to classify chest X-ray images for medical diagnosis (e.g., detecting pneumonia) by **automatically generating the best CNN architecture**, removing the need for manual trial-and-error in model design.
